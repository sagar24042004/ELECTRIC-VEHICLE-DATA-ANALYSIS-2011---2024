# 🚘 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard for analyzing the growth and distribution of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The dashboard is built using Tableau and explores insights such as EV adoption by model year, make, model, state, and eligibility for clean fuel programs.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Title:** Electric Vehicle Data Analysis
- **Objective:** To provide a clear, visual representation of electric vehicle trends across the U.S., helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions on policy, infrastructure, and marketing strategies.
- **Problem Solved:** Lack of centralized visibility into EV growth, regional distribution, and clean energy eligibility, especially in cities and counties like **King County (Seattle)**.

## 🧾 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Records:** ~150,000+
- **Key Fields:**
  - `Model Year`, `Make`, `Model`, `EV Type (BEV/PHEV)`
  - `State`, `City`, `County`
  - `Electric Range`, `CAFV Eligibility`

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Total Vehicles KPI:** Shows total number of EVs (1,50,422).
- **EV Type Distribution:** Donut chart displaying BEV (78%) vs PHEV (22.39%).
- **CAFV Eligibility:** Donut chart showing eligible vs non-eligible vehicles.
- **Model Year Trend:** Area chart showing EV growth from 2011 to 2024.
- **Top Models & Makes:** Horizontal bar charts for top EVs (e.g., Tesla Model Y, Model 3).
- **State Map:** Choropleth map showing vehicle counts by state (WA leads with 1,50,082 EVs).
- **Interactive Filters:** By EV type, make, model, CAFV status, and state.
